\begin{enumerate}
	\item The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground,which is $30$ m away from the foot of the tower is $45\degree$ .What is the height of the tower ?
	\item Find the sun's altitude if the shadow of a 15 m high tower is ${15}\sqrt{3}$ m.
	\item A circular piece of land is $40$ m in diameter. A well of diameter $16$ m has been dug to a depth of $28$ m and the earth taken out has been spread evenly over the remaining area. How much has the level of ground been raised ?
	\item From a point on the ground, $20$ m away from the foot of vertical tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $60\degree$. Find the height of the tower.
	\item
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In a right triangle ABC, right-angled at B, $BC= 6 cm$ and $AB = 8 cm$. A circle is inscribed in the {$\triangle$} ABC. Find the radius of the incircle.

	\end{enumerate}
	\item A solid sphere of radius r is melted and cast into the shape of a solid cone of height r. What is the radius of the base of the cone in terms of r ?
	\item Answer any four of the following questions :
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

	\item To explain how trignometry can be used measure the height of an inaccessible object, a teacher gave the following example to students :

		A TV tower stands vertically n the bank of a canal. From a point on the other bank direct opposite the tower, the angle of the elevation of the top of the tower is $60\degree$.From another point 20 m away from this point to the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $30\degree$ (as shown in Figure 1).
